# Connect or create a wallet

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="React">
    You can also use Privy to connect a user's external wallet if they have one, or to create an embedded wallet for them if they do not. This ensures users always have a connected wallet they can use with your application, and allows them to choose to use their external wallet if preferred.

    To do so, use the **`connectOrCreateWallet`** method of the **`usePrivy`** hook:

    ```tsx  theme={"system"}
    const {connectOrCreateWallet} = usePrivy();
    ```

    This method will prompt the user to connect an external wallet, or log in with email, SMS, or socials, depending on your configured `loginMethods`, to create an embedded wallet.

    <Info>
      Privy's `connectOrCreate` interface currently only supports external and embedded wallets on EVM
      networks.
    </Info>

    For example, you might have a "Connect" button in your app that prompts users to connect their wallet, like so:

    ```tsx  theme={"system"}
    import {useConnectOrCreateWallet} from '@privy-io/react-auth';

    export default function ConnectWalletButton() {
      const {connectOrCreateWallet} = useConnectOrCreateWallet();
      // Prompt user to connect a wallet with Privy modal
      return <button onClick={connectOrCreateWallet}>Connect wallet</button>;
    }
    ```

    <Tip>
      This method functions exactly the same as Privy's `login` method, except when users connect their
      external wallet, they will not automatically be prompted to authenticate that wallet by signing a
      message
    </Tip>

    ### Callbacks

    You can optionally pass callbacks to the `useConnectOrCreateWallet` hook to run custom logic after connecting a wallet or to handle errors.

    #### `onSuccess`

    ```tsx  theme={"system"}
    onSuccess: (args: {wallet: ConnectedWallet}) => Promise<void>;
    ```

    ##### Parameters

    <ParamField path="wallet" type="ConnectedWallet">
      The most recently connected wallet.
    </ParamField>

    #### `onError`

    ```tsx  theme={"system"}
    onError: (error: Error) => Promise<void>;
    ```

    ##### Parameters

    <ParamField path="error" type="Error">
      The error that occurred during the this flow.
    </ParamField>
  </Tab>
